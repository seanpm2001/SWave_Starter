### [Question] is there a custom startup sound for Windows Vista/Themes/Glass

I was uploading the sound effects, and noticed there was no custom startup sound for the `Glass` Windows Vista theme. Does this theme default to the default Windows XP or Vista startup sound, or is there some sound that I am not aware of?
