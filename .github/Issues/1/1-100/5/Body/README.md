### [Question] is there a custom shutdown sound for Windows 98/Plus/Dangerous creatures

I was uploading the sound effects, and noticed there was no custom shutdown sound for the `dangerous creatures` plus theme. Does this theme default to the default Windows 98 shutdown sound, or is there some sound that I am not aware of?
